Educational institutions continuously seek effective methods to evaluate and 
improve student performance. Attendance is a critical factor influencing academic 
success. This project presents a Student Performance Prediction System that uses 
Machine Learning techniques to classify students into performance categories 
based on attendance data. 
The system employs a Random Forest Classifier, a robust ensemble learning 
algorithm, to predict whether a student’s performance level is High, Medium, or 
Low. The dataset is preprocessed, cleaned, analyzed, and visualized before training 
the model. The system also allows real-time prediction through user input. The 
proposed solution helps educators identify students who require early intervention 
and academic support.
